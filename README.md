CreateWordList
==============

This is  perl script that can be used in conjunction with an exported site tree to generate a custom word list from terms used in the site's URLs.
  
  
    
<h4><b>Usage: </b> </h4> 
  
You can run this script in the following way:  
<b><i>perl createWorkdList.pl [input_file]</b></i>

as a note, the default  output is to the console.  If you'd like to create a new file or overwrite an existing one:  
<b><i>perl createWordList.pl [input_file] > [output_file]</b></i>

if you'd like to append to an existing file:  
<b><i>perl createWordList.pl [input_file] >> [output_file]</b></i>
